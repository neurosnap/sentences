    Needless to say , I was furious at this unparalleled intrusion upon free_enterprise.
   How dared they demand to  snoop  in_private financial records , disbursements , confidential contracts and agreements?
    It is as though  , I said on the historic three-hour , coast-to-coast radio_broadcast which I bought ( following Father_Coughlin and pre_empting the Eddie_Cantor , Manhattan_Merry-go-round and Major_Bowes shows )  That Man in the White_House , like some despot of yore , insisted on reading my diary , raiding my larder and ransacking my lingerie!
    My impassioned plea for civil_rights created a landslide of correspondence and one sponsor even asked me to consider replacing the Eddie_Cantor comedy hour on a permanent basis.
   But what quarter could a poor defenseless woman expect from a dictator who would even make so bold as to close all_of the banks in our great nation?
   The savage barbarian hordes of red Russian_Communism descended on the Athens that was mighty Metronome , sacking and despoiling with their Bolshevistic battle cry of  Soak the rich '!
   After an unspeakable siege , lasting the better part of two months , it was announced that the studio  owed  the government a tax debt in_excess of eight million dollars while I , who had always remained aloof from such iniquitous practices as paying taxes on the salary I had earned and the little I legally inherited as Morris ' helpless relict , was  stung  with a personal bill of such astronomical proportions as to  wipe_out  all_but a fraction of my poor , hard-come-by savings.
   I was also publicly reprimanded , dragged_through_the_mud by the radical press and made a figure of fun by such leftist publications as The New_Republic , The New_Yorker , Time and the Christian_Science Monitor.
     It was then that I availed myself of the rights of a citizen and declared the income_tax unconstitutional.
   The litigation was costly and seemingly endless.
   I fought like a tigress but by the time I appealed my case to the Supreme_Court ( 1937 ) , Mr._Roosevelt and his  henchmen  had done their  dirty work  all_too well , even going so_far as to attempt to  pack  the highest tribunal in the land in_order_to defeat little me.
   Presidential coercion had succeeded not_only in poisoning the courtiers ,  toadies  and sycophants of the  bench  against me , but it had been so far-reaching as to discourage any lawyer in the nation from representing me!
   I was ready , like Portia , to present my own brief.
   But the Supreme_Court would n't even hear my case!
   My plea was unanimously voted_down and  thrown_out .
   Again , my name was_on all the front pages.
   I was , it seemed , persona_non_grata in every_quarter , but not entirely without a staunch following of noted political thinkers and students of jurisprudence.
   As Charles_Evans_Hughes said ,  Miss_Poitrine 's limitations as an actress are exceeded only by her logic as a litigant .
   Albert_Einstein was quoted as saying :  The workings of the woman 's mind amaze me .
   Henry_Ford spoke of me as  utterly astounding .
   Heywood_Broun wrote :  Belle_Poitrine is the_most original thinker since Caligula  , and even F._D._R. had to concede that  if the rest of_this nation showed the foresight and patriotism of Miss_Poitrine , America would rapidly resemble ancient Babylon and Nineveh .
     Not_only were the court costs prohibitive , but I was subjected to crippling fines , in_addition to usurious interest on the unpaid  debts  which the governmen claimed that Metronome and I owed - a severe financial blow.
   Nor , as Manny said , had the notoriety done my career  any good .
   My enemies were only_too anxious to level against me such charges as  reactionary  ,  robber baroness  , and even  traitor !
   Traitor indeed!
   I point now with_pride to the fact that , long ere the Committee on Un-American_Activities , the Minute_Women , the Economic_Council and other such notable  watchdog  organizations were so_much as heard of , I was Hollywood 's leading bulwark against communism , fighting single-handedly  creeping socialism  against such insuperable odds as the Fascio-Communist troops of the NRA , PWA , WPA , CCC and an army of more_than twenty-two million mercenaries whom F._D._R. employed secretly , through the transparent ruse of regular  relief  checks.
     Needless to say , my art suffered drastically during this turbulent period.
   Could it do otherwise?
   Even_though I have always had a genius for  throwing myself into  every role and  playing it for all it 's worth  , no actress can be expected to do her best work when her fortune , her reputation , her livelihood , her home and her nation itself are all imperilled.
   Such sweeping distractions are hardly conducive to  Oscar  winning performances.
   I tried my hardest , with little help , may I say , from my husband and leading_man , but somehow the outside pressures were too severe.
     Having ( through my unflagging effort and devotion ) achieved stardom , a fortune and a world-renowned wife at an age when most young_men are casting their first vote , Letch proceeded to neglect them all.
   Never a  quick study  , he now made no attempt to learn his  lines  and many_a mile of film was wasted , many_a scene - sometimes involving as_many as a_thousand fellow thespians - was taken thirty , forty , fifty times because Miss_Poitrine 's co-star and  helpmate  had never learned his part.
   Each time Letch  went_up  in his  lines  , I was the one to be patient , helpful and apologetic while he indulged in outbursts of temperament , profanity and abuse , blaming others , going into  sulks  and , on more occasions than I care to count , storming off the  set  for the rest of the day.
   As for his finances , I was never privileged to know exactly how much money Letch had  salted_away .
   It was I who paid for our little home , the food , the liquor , the servants - even Letch 's bills at his tailor and the Los_Angeles Athletic_Club.
   Never once did he buy me a single gift and for our third anniversary he gave me a dislocated jaw.
   ( But that is another story.
 )   As for his private monies , they were rapidly dissipated in drinking , gaming and carousing.
   More_than once I was confronted by professional gamblers ,  bookies  , loan  sharks  , gangsters ,  thugs  and  finger men  - people of a class I did not even know existed - to repay my husband 's staggering losses ,  or_else .
   I shuddered to think that someone so dear to me could even associate with such a sinister milieu.
   And at three different times during our turbulent marriage strange girls , with the commonest of accents , telephoned to announce to me that Letch had sired their unborn children!
   Having the deepest of maternal instincts , my heart fairly bled when I thought_of the darling pink and white  bundles from heaven  I would have proudly given my husband.
    Ah , you 're too old  , was invariably his ungallant and untrue retort whenever I suggested  starting a family .
   Letch had made it abundantly clear that he did not care_for the company of my own precious daughter.
   I now felt it wiser_to keep Baby-dear in school and - during the summers - at a camp run by the Society_of_Friends all year around.
   Her presence only made Letch more distant and irritable and , in the hurry of buying Chateau_Belletch , I had neglected to consider a room for Baby-dear , so there was no place to put her , anyhow.
   ( I sometimes feel that God , in His infinite wisdom , wants us to have these inexplicable little lapses of memory.
   It almost always works_out for the best.
 )     Yet I adored this man , Letch_Feeley , why , I cannot say.
   With faint heart and a brave smile , I endured his long absences from Chateau_Belletch , his coldness , his indifference , his slights and his abuse.
   The times I can recall when I was publicly humiliated by him - lovely dinner_parties in our Trianon Suite where the collation was postponed and postponed and postponed , only to be served dry and overcooked at a table where the host 's chair was vacant ; a  splash party  at the new pool , which I had built in the hope of keeping Letch away from public beaches , when Letch and a certain Aquacutie stayed underwater together for the better part of an hour ; a lovely Epiphany party at Errol_Flynn 's , on_which sacred occasion Letch stole_away with an unknown  starlet  , leaving me  high and dry  to get home as best I could.
   These are but a sampling of the insults I endured.
   As Mrs._Letch_Feeley , was it any wonder that I , once the social arbiter of Filmdom , was excluded from the smart entertainments given by the Astaires , the Coopers , the Gables , the Colmans , the Rathbones , the Taylors , the Thalbergs and such devout , closely_knit families as the Barrymores and the Crosbys?
   As Letch 's antisocial conduct increased , our invitations decreased and my heart was in my mouth whenever I played hostess at a fashionable  screenland  gathering.
     Between 1935 and 1939 Letch and I made ten films together , each less successful , both artistically and commercially , than the one before it.
   Our last joint_venture , Sainted_Lady , a deeply religious film based on the life of Mother_Cabrini , and timed so_that its release date would coincide with the beatification of America 's first saint in November , 1938 , was a fiasco from_start_to_finish.
   As I was playing Mother_Cabrini , the picture was actually  all mine  , with nearly every scene built around me.
   But in_order_to keep Letch in_the_public_eye and out of trouble , I wrote in a part especially for him - that of a dashing ruffian who  sees the light  and is saved by the inspiring example of Mother_Cabrini.
   And did he appreciate my efforts on his behalf?
   Did he trouble to memorize the very small part which I had  tailor-made  to his specifications , a role eventually cut_down to three short speeches?
   Did he show the rest of the cast - numbering four thousand - the consideration of arriving_at the studio punctually - or even at_all?
   He did not!
   The  shooting  went_on for eight months!
   Most_of our working_days were spent on the telephone calling  bookies  , illegal gambling_dens , a certain  residential club for young_actresses  , more_than a_hundred different bars or the steam_room of the athletic club.
   Whenever he deigned to appear at the studio he was  hung_over  , uncooperative , rude and insulting.
   He made many tasteless , irreverent and unfunny remarks , not_only about me in the title_role , but about religion in_general.
   By the time the film was released we were three million dollars over-spent , war was imminent and the public apparently had forgotten all about Mother_Cabrini.
   Thanks to Letch_Feeley and the terrible strain he imposed on me , the notices were few and unfavorable.
   Only George_Santayana seemed to understand and appreciate the film when he wrote :  Miss_Poitrine has perpetrated the_most eloquent argument for the Protestant faith yet unleashed by Hollywood .
   But it was small consolation.
     In a rare fit of anger and spite , I  farmed_out  my own husband to a small and most undistinguished studio to make one picture as a form of punishment.
   ( An actor must have discipline.
 )   The film was called The Diet of Worms , which I felt was just what Letch deserved.
   It turned_out to be a life of Martin_Luther , of all things!
   It was a disaster!
   In clothes , Letch simply did not project.
   He was laughed_off the screen.
   At_the_same_time , however , I availed myself of the services of_that great English actor and master of make-up , Sir_Gauntley_Pratt , to do a  quickie  called The Mystery of the Mad_Marquess , in_which I played a young American girl who inherits a haunted castle on the_English moors which is filled with secret passages and sliding panels and , unbeknownst to anyone , is still occupied by an eccentric maniac.
   It was a  potboiler  made on a  shoestring  and not the sort_of film I like , as all I had to do was look blank and scream a great_deal.
   My heart was not in it , but , oddly_enough , it remains the_most financially successful picture of my career.
   ( I watched it on television late one night last week and it  stands_up  remarkably well , even twenty years later.
 )     Letch had returned from his debacle unrepentant and more badly_behaved than before.
   I really loved that boy , and , in a feverish attempt to preserve our marriage and to try to revive the wonderful , wonderful person Letch had once been , I took my troubles to Momma , hoping that her earthy advice would help me.
      If I could only think_of something at the studio , near me , to absorb his boundless energy  , I said.
    What is Letch interested in ?
      Bookies , booze and babes  , Momma said bluntly.
     Her reply stung me , but this was too important to let my hurt make any difference.
    I can n't turn the studio into a gambling_hell or a saloon  , I said.
